# Manual steps after running this script:
# 1. Open Xcode > Settings > Key Bindings and select "Vimious" as the active set.
# 2. Enable Vim Mode: Editor > Vim Mode.
# 3. Unbind Ctrl-6 from "Document Items" popup:
#    Xcode > Settings > Key Bindings > search "Document Items" > click the
#    shortcut field > press Delete to clear it. This frees Ctrl-6 (Ctrl-^),
#    which is the standard Vim binding for switching to the alternate file.
